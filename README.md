<h1> Titanic Survival Prediction </h1>
Welcome to the Titanic Survival Prediction project, developed as part of my internship at Seven7 Code Technologies.
In this project, we aim to predict the survival outcomes of passengers aboard the Titanic based on various features and data analysis.

<h1> Project Overview</h1>
The Titanic Survival Prediction project is a classic machine learning task that involves analyzing historical data about passengers who were on board the Titanic during its ill-fated maiden voyage. 
Using this data, we will build a predictive model to determine whether a passenger survived or not.

<h1> Environment </h1>
This project was developed using Google Colab, an online integrated development environment (IDE) for Python that provides a seamless platform for coding, data analysis, and machine learning tasks.

<h1>Getting Started</h1>
<h3>To get started with this project, follow these steps:</h3>

-> Clone or download this repository to your local machine.<br>
-> Open the Jupyter Notebook in Google Colab or any Python IDE of your choice.<br>
-> Run the code cells to execute the analysis and prediction.<br>

<h1>Data</h1>
We will be working with the Titanic dataset in Kaggle, which contains information about passengers such as their age, gender, ticket class, fare, and more.
The dataset is divided into a training set and a testing set for model training and evaluation.

<h1>Model Building</h1>
We will employ various machine learning techniques, such as logistic regression, decision trees, and random forests, to build and evaluate our prediction model.
The goal is to create a model that accurately predicts the survival status of passengers based on the provided data.

<h1>Evaluation</h1>
The success of our prediction model will be measured using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
We aim to achieve the best possible performance on these metrics.

<h1>Conclusion</h1>
This Titanic Survival Prediction project is an exciting exploration into the world of machine learning and data analysis.
By the end of this project, we hope to gain valuable insights into the factors that influenced survival rates on the Titanic.

Thank you for taking the time to explore this project, and we look forward to sharing our findings and model with you.

<h3>Happy coding!</h3>
